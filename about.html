   <p style="text-align:center;"> <b><i>VIVO Pro Kabaddi League(PKL)</i></b> is a ground-breaking initiative by Mashal Sports Pvt. Ltd and Star India Pvt. Ltd. Ever since its inception in 2014, The League has revolutionised the sport of kabaddi with stunning innovations, making it an aspirational sport for players and fans alike. Backed by the Amateur Kabaddi Federation of India (AKFI), and supported by participating members of the International Kabaddi Federation (IKF) and the Asian Kabaddi Federation (AKF), the league has witnessed tremendous growth over the past seasons. </p>
   <p style="text-align:center;"><b><i>Pro Kabaddi League (PKL)</i></b> is the top franchise-based kabaddi tournament in the world. With a blend of local and international talent, Pro Kabaddi has helped revolutionise the sport of kabaddi in India since it started in 2014.Corporates and big names took interest and stepped in to launch their teams, each with their own colours and identities.A better version of regular indoor kabaddi, Pro Kabaddi includes additional rules like do-or-die raid (a mandatory raid followed by two consecutive empty raids) and Super Tackle (tackles worth two points if three or fewer defenders are on the mat) to encourage scoring and arouse more interest in the game.Since its inception in 2014, PKL has been played every year except in 2020, when it was called off due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
   <p style="text-align:center;">Initially starting with eight teams, Pro Kabaddi expanded to 12 teams in Season 5 in 2017 with the addition of Gujarat Giants (formerly called Gujarat Fortunegiants), Haryana Steelers, U.P. Yoddha and Tamil Thalaivas. 
   Patna Pirates are the most successful team in Pro Kabaddi winning the PKL title a record three times in a row in seasons 3, 4 and 5. </p>
